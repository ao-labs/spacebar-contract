# Checkpoints







*This library defines the `History` struct, for checkpointing values as they change at different points in time, and later looking up past values by block number. See {Votes} as an example. To create a history of checkpoints define a variable type `Checkpoints.History` in your contract, and store a new checkpoint for the current transaction block using the {push} function. _Available since v4.5._*
